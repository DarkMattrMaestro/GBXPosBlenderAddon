## About

GBXPos is a blender addon that lets you import TMNF/TMUF replays into Blender. It is mainly meant to be a video editing tool, making compositing 3D and 2D objects into a replay easier.

Here is an example of something that can be done with the addon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR4xeBVV2Js
